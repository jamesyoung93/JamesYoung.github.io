## Ph.D., Molecular Biology, South Dakota State University, 2017-2021
* Dissertation on Oxygen Tolerant Nitrogen Fixation in Photosynthetic Cyanobacteria
* Using molecular and bioinformatic techniques
While a Ph.D. is more about producing original and rigorous research, some of the classes I took that directly contributed to my research include
Next Generation Sequencing
Stat 736 - Bioinformatics
Advanced Molecular Biology
Bacteriology
Molecular Research Techniques
Biological Imaging
Seminar I and II

Big Ideas: Energy minimization (increasing entropy), networked systems (delegation, safe-guards), information (quantifiable measurements), and rate of change (anticipating the future).  Synthesizing the courses below into a framework that can be applied to problem-solving in general, my take

**Energy Minimization:** Why does energy flow from a hot object to a cold object, why does breaking a bond release more energy than it takes to break, why does a protein have a specific conformation (plus or minus vibration)? 

**Networked Systems:** The

Biochemistry I & II 
 - Protein folding and metabolic cycles. Protein folding is a highly complex process (with secondary, tertiary, and quaternary conformations) that is vital to functional proteins (which allow us to live). The process is basically an energy minimization process that balances variables of hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, polarity, hydrogen bonds, and van der waals forces amongst other forces. Metabolic cycles consider the network of proteins that work together to break down or buildup molecules for energy or 
PChem I (Thermodynamics) 
 - partial differentials
Calculus I & II
 - Derivatives and integrals, finding the velocity or acceleration or area under the curve.
 
Physics I & II
 - 
 
Organic Chem I & II
 - Besides learning patterns of the periodic table for reactions, the concept that really sticks out to me is working backwards for planning. In this class it was planning a chemical synthesis, but this concept can be used elsewhere. Wheter constructing a house and working backward from the desired end product to ensure proper sequence or planning and executing project.
