I am a data scientist, Ph.D. candidate in molecular biology, and M.Sc. student in data science at South Dakota State University. I will finish my courses for both degrees and research for my Ph.D. in May 2021. My most recent data science experience has been an ongoing internship with NetApp working mostly on statistical forecasting. 

I have mostly used R in my data science work, but have experience using Python in data science competitions and coursework, and SAS and SQL through coursework. Most recently I have started learning the {tidyverse} coupled with {purrr} and {dplyr}. 

In my free time, I like to play board games, enter competitions, hike, make Shiny dashboards, and play pick up sports. I have recently started skiing and find that very exciting as well. 

Below are links to some of my previous projects and work, most of which were created prior to my introduction of {tidyverse}.
